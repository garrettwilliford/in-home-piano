My Piano Website


This is the code I wrote for my piano website! 
Before working as a Data Engineer/Analyst I gave in home piano lessons
I decided to start it back up and having some fun creating a simple website to touch up my javascript skills.

Its a simple website with very little functionality, more to give a description of the experience of learning piano as well as my contact information
